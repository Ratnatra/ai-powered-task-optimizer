# Zidio AI-Powered Task Optimizer

## Description
This project focuses on leveraging data science and machine learning techniques to analyze employee emotions and moods using data such as text inputs, facial expressions, or speech. The system provides insights into the emotional state of employees and recommends tasks that align with their mood to enhance productivity and well-being. Additionally, it detects employees who may be experiencing stress, burnout, or other negative emotions and notifies HR or higher authorities to take timely action. This ensures that appropriate support, such as counseling, stress management programs, or task adjustments, can be provided, fostering a healthier and more empathetic workplace environment.

## Features
1. **Real-Time Emotion Detection**
   - Combines text analysis, live camera video, and speech processing to detect employee emotions comprehensively.
2. **Task Recommendation**
   - Suggests tasks based on the detected mood.
3. **Historical Mood Tracking**
   - Maintains a timeline of each employee's mood trends to identify patterns and provide insights into long-term well-being.
4. **Stress Management Alerts**
   - Automatically notifies HR or managers when an employee's mood indicates prolonged stress or disengagement.
5. **Team Mood Analytics**
   - Aggregates mood data across teams to identify overall morale and productivity trends.
6. **Data Privacy**
   - Ensures sensitive data is anonymized and securely stored.
